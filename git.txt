1. Initialize Local Repository

git init

2. Add all Files for version control with

git add .

3.Create a commit with message of your choice

git commit -m 'AddingBaseCode'

4.Initialize Remote Repository

Create a project on Github and copy the URL of your project and copy URL of the project.
Click on "Clone or Download" botton on the git website

5.Link Remote repo with Local repo

Now use copied URL to link your local repo with remote GitHub repo. When you clone a repository with git clone, it automatically creates a \
remote connection called origin pointing back to the cloned repository. The command remote is used to manage set of tracked repositories.

git remote add origin https://github.com/hiteshsahu/Hassium-Word.git

6.Synchronize
Now we need to merge local code with remote code. This step is critical otherwise we won be able to Push Code on Github. You must call     \
'git pull' before pushing your code.

git pull origin master --allow-unrelated-histories

7.Commit your code: Finally push all changes on Github

git push -u origin master
